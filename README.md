# do-it-in-time
"Match in Time!"
For CSCE A201 project at UAA. Due November 26, 2023.
By Ian Rodriguez and Zelan Allen.

This is a game where the user earns a score by matching 16 cards in a limited amount of time.

The purpose behind the program is to attempt to integrate several systems we learned in class into a single game, such as time.h, rand(), arrays/vectors, user-made functions, increments/decrements, etc. It's also an attempt to be as user-friendly as possible with a clear objective, good formatting, and proper error handling.

The program should be run in Visual Studio or Code::Blocks like any other assignment for the course.
